# Q: What is Insertion Sort?
# ðŸ‘‰ Itâ€™s a sorting method that puts each element in its correct place, one by one â€” like sorting playing cards in your hand.

# Q: How does it work?
# ðŸ‘‰ It takes one element, compares it with the left side, and keeps moving it left until itâ€™s in the right spot.

# Example:
# [5, 3, 4, 1] â†’ [3, 5, 4, 1] â†’ [3, 4, 5, 1] â†’ [1, 3, 4, 5]
