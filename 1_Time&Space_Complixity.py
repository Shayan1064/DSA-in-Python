# Time complexity shows how efficient your code is when data grows.
# What is O(N) and what does it mean...

# O = Worst case (upper bound).
# Ω = Best case (lower bound).
# Θ = Average case (tight bound).

# for i in range(n):        # Outer loop
#     for j in range(n):    # Inner loop
#         print(i, j)

# Outer loop runs n times.

# For each run of the outer loop, the inner loop also runs n times.

# So total = n × n = n² iterations.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Space Complexity → Total memory used by an algorithm (input + extra).

# Input Space → Memory required to store the input data.

# Auxiliary Space → Extra memory used by the algorithm (temporary variables, arrays, etc.).

# Server do 10 power 8 operation in one second if it exceed then it is called Time Limit Exceeded.
